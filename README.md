The following is a description of the Hidden Grotto theme, designed for use in Obsidian. 

# Introduction
This theme is primarily designed for personal use. Since I have been using it for a while, I decided to make it available for others to use. The base color palette was inspired by the Pokemon, Clobbopus. It's not my favourite or anything. The colours just work well together. There are additional color options accessible through the Hidden Grotto Controls plugin (may or may not be available on the plugin store at the time of writing this; accessible through github [here](https://github.com/HotAndCold245/Hidden-Grotto-Controls) . 

#Note : The font used in the images for this theme is called Quicksand and can be found through Google Fonts.

# Mobile Toolbar and Navbar
The mobile toolbar and navbar appearance has been changed. The view actions (reading/editing toggle and more options) have been moved to the bottom for easier reach. Additionally, the file path has been hidden for extra room.

The maximum toolbar height (number of rows visible) can be adjusted using the plugin. Alternatively, `--grotto-toolbar-rows` controls it. It takes number of rows as input. If there are more tools than a row can hold while maximum height is set to 1, then the toolbar can be swiped up to access the rest of the tools. This is a change from the default behaviour of swiping to the left because it let's you see more of the tools at once. 

#Note : Setting the height to more rows than necessary to hold the active number of tools will cause the mobile toolbar to move further up than intended. 

# The Plugin
There is a plugin developed for use with this theme that allows for more customization. Beyond the options mentioned, there are options to set separate colour palettes through primary and secondary colour types. The secondary type controls the accent and primary controls the rest. You can create your own preset for the separate types using `body.primary-type-` and `body.secondary-type-`. Additionally, you can set full presets using `body.preset-`.  The plugin allows to easily swap between palettes using ribbon buttons. You can then mix different primary and secondary palettes.
